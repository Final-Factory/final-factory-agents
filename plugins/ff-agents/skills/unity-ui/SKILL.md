# Unity UI: build it, then verify it like a player

The w644 Deck hub (#1251) passed a tour of 28 stills and broke on Ben's Deck: navy instead of the
game's teal-blue, Crafting cut to one row, no tech grid, the Blueprints preview off the bottom with
flickering icons, Factory info in a corner of its pane. Every check had asked "does it open and
fit", none "does it show everything and look like the game" (evidence-gate,
`lessons/verify-ui-with-full-content-like-a-player.md`). This skill is how to avoid that.

## 1. Know the UI you are changing

- Read the game repo's `docs/UI-Architecture.md` first: uGUI only (no UI Toolkit), scene-authored in
  `Assets/Scenes/main.unity`, `UiController` owns the HUD, panels toggle with `SetActive`. Its §3b
  is the structured layout (`Assets/Scripts/UI/Structured/`: `StructuredDock`, `StructuredHub`,
  `StationPanel`, `StructuredTabStrip`) and `UI/Components/WindowFit`, `KeepOnScreen`.
- **Canvas scale is not the screen.** `UiScaler.ScaleFactor` (`Assets/Scripts/UI/UiScaler.cs`)
  sets every HUD canvas's `scaleFactor` from the screen and the UI-scale setting (default 0.90,
  locked on the Deck's own screen). Below 1920x1080 the UI stops shrinking with the screen: at
  1280x800 the canvas is about 1343x839 layout units against 2133x1200 at 1920x1080 (both at 0.90).
  A window laid out for desktop gets about 70 % of its height on a Deck. Check sizes in canvas
  units at the real scale factor, never against a desktop Game view.
- **Reuse the existing look.** The classic windows' frame sprite and colours come from the scene's
  panels (`StructuredHub.Panel` copies a window's `Image` sprite, type and colour). A colour typed
  into code (`StructuredHub.Shade`'s `new Color(0.04f, 0.07f, 0.11f, 0.96f)`) is a style change the
  requester never saw. Copy the skin from the classic panel the screen replaces.
- **One owner per size.** Before you set a RectTransform's size or position, find who else does:
  its parent's layout group, a `ContentSizeFitter`, `WindowFit`, `ListGrow`, `KeepOnScreen`,
  `MaxHeightViewport`. Two owners alternate frame by frame, and that is flicker (the hub's own
  comment: "a second fit fighting it made the window jump").

The uGUI rules and the pitfalls with their fixes: [ugui-pitfalls.md](ugui-pitfalls.md).

## 2. Write down what "right" means, per screen, before the first shot

One line per screen and sub-view: the requester's words (quoted), and what full content is
("Crafting: every row of the selected category's grid"; "Technology: the tree grid with nodes";
"Blueprints: the list, and a selected blueprint's preview whole on screen"; "Factory info: its
stats filling the pane"; "the colours of the classic Inventory"). Put the words in a file for
`ui_check.py shots --words`. Without this list a still can only be checked against itself.

## 3. Check the layout in the editor while you work

In play mode, with the Game view at the target size (1280x800 for the Deck) and the screen open,
run the rect audit through `execute_code` ([rect-audit.md](rect-audit.md)). It lists, for the open
UI: graphics off screen, content cut by a mask that cannot scroll, grids showing fewer rows than
they hold, scroll views whose content cannot scroll, windows using little of their pane, and big
flat fills with their colour. Fix what it lists before you build a player. It is a quick check, not
the verdict: the verdict is a built player (section 4).

## 4. Verify in a built player, with full content

The game repo's Deck tour (`Assets/Scripts/Diagnostics/DeckTour.cs`; `docs/UI-Architecture.md`
§3b; scripts in `specs/w644-deck-release/tour/`, `scripts/deck_audit/`) drives a development player
with a scripted Deck: `-ffDeckTour <steps.json> -ffDeckTourOut <dir> -ffDeckTourSize 1280x800
[-ffDeckTourUiScale <s>] [-ffDeckTourQuit]`, launched from the slot pool
(`python scripts/nightly/player_slots.py launch <build> -- <args>`). Each `shot` saves a PNG and a
census (`<shot>.json`: small, clipped, off-screen and overlapping text, covered controls).

- **Content.** Tour a late-game world. Load one with `{"setup": "ffauto:ui.loadgame|<save name>"}`
  (the save copied into the saves folder under a name of your own, removed afterwards). To fill a
  new world: `ffauto:cheats.enable`, then `ffauto:player.devunlock` (every technology and a starter
  pack, `LocalMultiplayerAutomationCommandRunner.ExecutePlayerDevUnlock`), `ffauto:inventory.add|
  <item>|<count>` for a full inventory. `devunlock` researches everything, so a tree that is partly
  done (the common late-game case) needs a real save. A tab that is empty in the save is "not
  verified", never PASS.
- **Every sub-view.** Per tab: select an item, hover one, open its preview or second page, scroll
  the list to the end (`at` + `press right_trigger`, `stick`). A tour that only presses R1 tests the
  tab strip.
- **Wait for content.** `{"waitFor": "text:<something only the filled screen shows>"}` before each
  `shot`, not a fixed `wait`.
- **Clips at real rate.** `{"record": "<name>", "seconds": 4}` saves every frame as JPGs in
  `clip-<name>/` (with `frames.txt` for ffmpeg). Record each screen idle and while hovering and
  selecting. Never stitch the stills into a 1 fps "clip".
- **Both arms.** The "before" is the classic screen with the same content (`{"layout": "classic"}`),
  so style and fill can be compared; develop with nothing open compares nothing.

## 5. Check the pixels, then look at every still yourself

`scripts/deck_audit/ui_check.py` in the game repo (numpy + Pillow; rects are image pixels from the
top-left, or pass `--unity-y` for a tour `rect:` log line):

```sh
python scripts/deck_audit/ui_check.py flicker <tour>/clip-hub-blueprints --rect 0,60,1280,800 --out flicker.png
python scripts/deck_audit/ui_check.py fill <tour>/h4-factory-info.png --pane 0,60,1280,790
python scripts/deck_audit/ui_check.py style <tour>/h1-inventory.png --rect 40,80,600,700 \
    --ref <tour>/c1-classic-inventory.png --ref-rect 300,150,860,770
python scripts/deck_audit/ui_check.py shots <tour> --words words.txt     # writes <tour>/shots.md
```

- `flicker`: regions that change and change back within 4 frames, twice or more. 0 is the bar.
- `fill`: the content's span of the pane and the largest empty band; under 60 % or a band over 40 %
  is flagged. It needs an opaque pane (a translucent classic window lets the world count as content).
- `style`: background colour and palette against the classic panel; delta E over 10 is flagged.
- `shots`: one row per still with its census flags. Fill in every row while looking at the still at
  full size: what it shows, whole or not, classic look or not, which of the requester's words it
  meets or breaks. That sheet is "Looked: yes".

Then the evidence-gate's [UI checklist](../evidence-gate/checklists/ui.md) and, in the PR, the
`Content:`, `Full content:`, `Style:`, `Shots:` lines and a flicker result (`pr_evidence.py`
fails a UI change without them). Publish the stills, clips and the sheet with `publish_review`, and
put the stills of every screen in front of the person who asked for the look.

## 6. Not verified, said plainly

No real Deck: "Not verified: Deck hardware". No late-game save: say which tabs were empty. Never
turn a gap into a PASS by listing it under "Not verified" while the title says the screen works.
